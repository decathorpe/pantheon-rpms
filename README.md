# Pantheon packages for Fedora 38+ (work-in-progress)

This repository contains WIP packages of Pantheon for Fedora 38 and Rawhide,
based on my original packaging for Fedora < 37.

The goal is to add the packages back to Fedora once enough components have
been revived to provide a working desktop environment again.

Until then, builds of these packages are provided in a [COPR].

For local mock builds, a mock configuration for rawhide / x86_64 is provided.
